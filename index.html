                How are you doing? I hope you're doing alright because I'm doing great as well. The past few months I was thinking about you and how we would spend our time together. Most especially the awkward places or situations on how we would meet. First meetups are always the fun to reminisce as we go further in our relationship, as it is the strong foundation of our love. Be it online or personal, it does not matter.

          <p class="girl-content-paragraph">
            Where ever you go, always remember is to learn to fight for yourself, to never be
            scared to open up. Always have a positive mindset. Were gonna make a lot of mistakes, but learning nothing from the mistake is the MISTAKE. And if you ever need an extra hand, I will be here for you in the future.
            <br><br>
            I also wanted to thank you in advance that I will get to know someone like you, giving me a chance to feel love again. I genuinely feel the support and sweetness you will give and always wanted to
            give it back. I'm so tired of being single and I just miss the warmth of love. I hope you don't mind a clingy guy and I am so excited to see you. I also wanted to introduce you to my Family. My Nagging Mom, My Friendly Bros and My Playful Sister.
            <br><br>
            I look like I don't care, but I really do. In fact, I even get to miss people like you every time.
            There's always the right time to give hugs, the right time to kiss and the right time to love.
            This is just a bad time for us both, as we need to prioritize first on what goals and challenges that are in front of us. Future achievements that we dream to attain!
            <br><br>
            I wish us the best of luck in our goals and our meetup! I will always love you, support you and just scream out to the whole world that you are the woman in my life.
            If you ever do need someone to talk to in the future. Winter, Spring, Summer or Fall, 
            all you've got to do is call
            <br><br>
            But for now I understand why we need to be single, it is for us to establish ourselves and be ready for what is ahead of us!
