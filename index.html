                How do you do? I hope you're doing alright because I'm doing great as well. I know things have been tough for you lately in the apartment, but I always believe you can do it. I've always had an admiration for you and I'm happy for you making your coffee as you do your job. I'm happy for Bailey for having a playmate called Negga I mean Neggy. Sorry racist haha! And best of all we just be happy for what God gives us everyday.

            Somehow I've managed to code this online letter to tell you to take care going to the beach. I am not sure about your throat condition but I hope you are somewhat better today. Just don't forget to bring a few meds just incase anything happens.. Or baka need mo lang uminom ng salt water para matanggal na ubo mo haha! Joke..

            Being with friends is always a blessing. It's what makes the world beautiful and it's what refreshes the soul. Just go out there jump around, run around, crawl around, swim around and what not because you deserve this and I know you enjoy this. 
            <br><br>
            Sometimes I would act like that I don't care, but I really do care for you above all else.
            Sure it may sound too dramatic for people. But I mean it.
            I know I just didn't have the right to care for you when you were sick, and you really want to do these things on your own. But there is nothing wrong with letting people who you care for help you.
            I told you once before in a song that you mean the entire world to me
            <br><br>
            I believe there's a right time for everything. We just keep going.
            Apologies for being stubborn. And if I can't scream out to whole world anymore that you are the woman in my life!
            For me you are still beautiful. I love you and I'll always be here for you. 
            <br><br>
            If you ever do need someone to talk to. Winter, Spring, Summer or Fall, 
            all you've got to do is call.
            <br><br>
            Enjoy sa Beach!
